In my Customer Churn Prediction project, I tackled the challenge of predicting customer churn using a binary outcome. I tested multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Random Forest emerged as the best performer for this model.

To address the issue of class imbalance, I applied the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which balanced the training data and improved precision and recall scores. Additionally, I used Standard Scaler for data normalization, ensuring equal contribution from all features. This approach resulted in a robust and reliable churn prediction model with enhanced accuracy, with Random Forest providing the best results for this dataset.
